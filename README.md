# 🍽️ Mess Master AI – Smart Campus Meal Management

## 🔍 Problem

College messes across India face daily challenges like:
- **Over-preparation or food wastage**
- Lack of **dietary personalization**
- No **real-time inventory** or **demand forecasting**
- No **health insights** or **feedback system** for meals

These inefficiencies lead to:
- Waste of food & resources
- Poor nutrition for students
- No insights into meal quality or health balance

---

## 💡 Our Solution: **Mess Master AI**

A unified AI-powered web solution to:
- Predict **meal demand**
- Offer **personalized meal suggestions**
- Track **student health metrics (BMI, calorie intake, etc.)**
- Reduce food wastage using **inventory logic**
- Reward students using a **gamified leaderboard system**

Built to support **both students and mess admins**.

## 🚀 MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

We’ve developed a functional MVP that includes:

✅ **4 core frontend modules**  
✅ All HTML/CSS/JS hosted on GitHub Pages  
✅ Backend (Flask + Python) is built but **not uploaded publicly** due to confidential code and model logic

### 🎯 What’s Special in the MVP?
- **No backend dependency**: All 4 modules run fully on frontend
- Built for GitHub Pages and hackathon demos
- Includes AI-like logic for health and meal recommendations using **pure JavaScript**
