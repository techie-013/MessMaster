## 🚀 MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

We’ve developed a functional MVP that includes:

✅ **4 core frontend modules**  
✅ All HTML/CSS/JS hosted on GitHub Pages  
✅ Backend (Flask + Python) is built but **not uploaded publicly** due to confidential code and model logic

### 🎯 What’s Special in the MVP?
- **No backend dependency**: All 4 modules run fully on frontend
- Built for GitHub Pages and hackathon demos
- Includes AI-like logic for health and meal recommendations using **pure JavaScript**
